# Owkin UI

## Overview

This project is a draft version of a React application built with Vite, Redux Toolkit, and TailwindCSS. The goal was to create a functional, responsive web application utilizing modern development tools and practices.

## Technology Stack

- **React**: For its component-based architecture.
- **Vite**: As a fast and efficient build tool.
- **Redux Toolkit**: For efficient state management.
- **TailwindCSS**: For its utility-first approach to styling.


## With More Time
- **Testing**: Implementing tests using Jest and React Testing Library.
- **Add more features**: For better mobile user experience need to add modal windows for full view. Also, need to add drag and drop functionality to make it easier to add files.
- **Accessibility Improvements**: Ensuring compliance with WCAG guidelines.
